this is my 4th Data Analysis Project
This project has helped me to analyze data and understand the importance of data
types, rows, and columns in data analysis.
During the data analysis process, I identified and dealt with blank cells and non-value
data such as (-) that could skew the results in unexpected ways. I also learned about
outliers and their impact on data visualization.
Using this project, I was able to implement various features of Pivot tables and create
multiple charts to visualize the data. I then grouped all the charts and created a
dashboard.
I understood what is EDA and how to perform it.
Overall, colors played an important role in data visualization, making it easier to
interpret and understand the data.
